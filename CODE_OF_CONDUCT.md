In addition to communicating your expectations, a code of conduct describes the following:

Where the code of conduct takes effect (only on issues and pull requests, or community activities like events?)
Whom the code of conduct applies to (community members and maintainers, but what about sponsors?)
What happens if someone violates the code of conduct
How someone can report violations
Wherever you can, use prior art. The Contributor Covenant is a drop-in code of conduct that is used by over 40,000 open source projects, including Kubernetes, Rails, and Swift.

The Django Code of Conduct and the Citizen Code of Conduct are also two good code of conduct examples.

Place a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file in your projectâ€™s root directory, and make it visible to your community by linking it from your CONTRIBUTING or README file.
